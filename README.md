# Creating a Kindle Kids Book - Using AI

*I wrote a book suitable for story time, for those tech-geeky parents with kids being our future data scientists.*

## Goal
For the day I have kids, I want to be able to merge my interest in AI and Machine Learning with the time I will spend with them reading fictional stories emphasising themes such as, *Courage, Friendship, Belonging/Identity, Family, Loss/Grief and Growing Up.*

This project will be the foundation of being able to produce short kids stories and publish them on the kindle store for parents around the world to enjoy with their family. 

Now let's get away from this emotional part and get to the coding and planning parts, shall we? 


## Setup/Plan
We start of by setting the scene. 
* ```Main character```: Bob the robot. 
* ```Theme of the story```: Courage. 
* ```Lenght```: A story should be between 15-30 min reading time, which should be equivalent to 1500-3000 words (slow reading speed)
* ```Style```: Repetitive. Comfortable style for getting the kids sleepy and ready for bedtime.
* ```Topics```: The different characters they get help from to find the young boys parents are planets, with characteristics from their Greek/Roman mythology. So while our kids enjoy this wonderful tail, they learn subconsiously what to associate each planet with in accordance to the astronomy and greek/roman mythology.  


## What's AIs purpose in this project

In short, it's used for generating text based on a few key facts and utilise data from another story as a framework, to get a new text. So the main point here is to use it as a tool in our creation of the story, and not to let/make the AI generat/create a complete story (impossible with the GPT-3 limitations of 2500 words). 



## How to enjoy the book

I'd like to say that this is more for people interested to have something quick to read to their kid, you'll find more pleasant stories by for example H.C. Andersen. But if you're intrested in AI & Machine Learning, I hope this serve you well and be a fun future talking point with your kid when he, she or them are older.
