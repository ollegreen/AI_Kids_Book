# Creating a Kindle Kids Book Using AI

*Let's write a book suitable for story time, for those tech-geeky parents.*

## Goal
For the day I have kids, I want to be able to merge my interest in AI and Machine Learning with the time I will spend with them reading fictional stories emphasising themes such as, *Courage, Friendship, Belonging/Identity, Family, Loss/Grief and Growing Up.*

This project will be the foundation of being able to produce short kids stories and publish them on the kindle store for parents around the world to enjoy with their family. 

Now let's get away from this emotional part and get to the coding and planning parts, shall we? 


## Setup/Plan
We start of by setting the scene. 
* ```Main character```: Bob the robot. 
* ```Theme of the story``` -- Courage. 
* ```How long should the story be?```: A story should be between 15-30 min reading time, which should be equivalent to 1500-3000 words (slow reading speed)
* ```Style```: Repetitive. For example go find different people who are represented by planets. Then they continue to find the next planet and so on, so it's repetitive and comfortable to read to the kids, and make them a bit sleepy. 






## How to enjoy the book

I'd like to say that this is more for people interested to have something quick to read to their kid, you'll find more pleasant stories by for example H.C. Andersen. But if you're intrested in AI & Machine Learning, I hope this serve you well and be a fun future talking point with your kid when he, she or them are older. 

Cheers.
